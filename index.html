                <p>I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of Michigan beginning Fall 2021. I recently completed my PhD in the Princeton Computer Science department, advised by <a href="../~mrm/">Prof. Margaret Martonosi.</a> I am currently doing a "pre-battical" with <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/">Prof. Sanjit Seshia</a> at UC Berkeley in between graduation and starting at Michigan.
                
                <p>My research lies on the boundary between computer architecture and formal methods, and focuses on developing automated formal methodologies and tools for the design and verification of computing systems. My work spans the hardware/software stack, from high-level programming languages down to low-level Verilog circuits. During my PhD, my research focused on the verification of memory consistency model (MCM) properties in parallel hardware and software. MCMs specify the ordering rules for memory operations used for communication and synchronization in shared-memory parallel programs, so MCM verification is critical to parallel system correctness. My work has found real-world bugs in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01507.pdf">C++ compilers</a>, <a href="papers/MICRO-50_Manerkar.pdf">an open-source processor implementation in Verilog</a>, and in <a href="papers/ctrippel_ASPLOS17.pdf">the widely-used RISC-V instruction set (ISA)</a>. My work has also enriched the formal methods community by developing new formal analysis techniques.</p>

                <p>Before joining Princeton, I completed my BASc in Computer Engineering at the
                <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering">University of Waterloo</a> and a M.S. in Computer
                Science and Engineering at the <a href="http://cse.umich.edu">University of Michigan.</a> I also worked full-time
                at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/research">Qualcomm Research</a> for one year.</p>
                <p> I was a recipient of Princeton's Wallace Memorial Fellowship for the 2018-2019 academic year. The Wallace Memorial Fellowship is a <a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/costs-funding/sources-funding/fellowships/competitive">Princeton Honorific Fellowship</a> which provides funding to students displaying the highest scholarly excellence in graduate work during the year. I also received the 2019 Award for Excellence from Princeton's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).</p>
                <p> I was selected to attend the 7th <a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/">Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF)</a> in September 2019. The HLF is an annual event where 200 young researchers in computer science and mathematics participate in a weeklong scientific exchange with recipients of the top awards in computing and mathematics (Turing Award, Abel Prize, Fields Medal, ACM Prize in Computing, and the Nevanlinna Prize).</p>

<p>We entrust large parts of our daily lives to computer systems, and these systems require thorough verification to ensure their correctness. System vulnerabilities can lead to leakage of confidential information, loss of money, and (in the case of cyber-physical systems) may even threaten one's physical safety and security. Many such bugs have in fact been found in computing systems in recent years, ranging from security vulnerabilities (like Meltdown and Spectre) to network errors to concurrency bugs.</p>

<p>Some important bugs are due to flaws in system design/specification, while others are due to implementations violating the design specification. Since verification is generally focused late in development, bugs tend to get caught late in development as well. Design bugs may necessitate a redesign, wasting the development time spent creating incorrect implementations. Furthermore, many bugs only occur in very specific scenarios, making them hard to find. Current verification processes have proven inadequate for catching these bugs, resulting in the release of flawed hardware and software.</p>

<p>Verification using formal methods provides strong correctness guarantees based on mathematical proofs, and is adept at catching hard-to-find bugs. My work aims to improve the verification of hardware and software using formal methods, without requiring engineers to have formal methods expertise. I propose a philosophy of <b>Progressive Automated Formal Verification</b>, i.e. verification throughout the system development process, from early-stage design through to final implementation.
Progressive verification has multiple benefits, including reductions in verification overhead and in overall development time.
Automating formal verification also enables engineering teams to prove strong correctness properties about their designs and implementations by themselves, shifting the verification burden away from the relatively small number of formal methods experts.</p>

<p>In progressive verification, formal models of systems are first created and verified during early-stage design, thus catching design bugs <i>before</i> implementation commences. These models can then evolve to become more detailed as system design progresses. Once the system is implemented, the implementation is formally verified against a proven-correct design model to help ensure implementation correctness. The number of steps in a progressive verification flow may vary depending on the type of system being built, but the key idea is to conduct verification throughout the design timeline and link the verification methods at each stage together.</p>

<p>The work in my dissertation constitutes a concrete instance of a progressive verification flow for MCM properties in parallel processors. However, progressive verification is a generic flow, and is applicable to other types of properties like hardware security properties. It is also applicable to other types of systems like cyber-physical systems.</p>
